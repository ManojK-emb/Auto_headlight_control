# Auto_headlight_control

During night driving the headlight of vehicles 
must be switched properly. Mostly while driving vehicle 
drivers use high beam lights instead of low beam in all 
situations. The high beam should be used only when there’s 
low visibility or in highways and you should consider the 
other drivers in mind. While travelling in a dak road if you 
notice an oncoming vehicle or traffic, it’s advisable to switch 
the headlight to low beam. It can dazzle the driver ahead by 
reflecting in the rearview mirror and cause lose in visibility 
and result in accident. In this proposed idea the headlight 
can be controlled manually as well as automatically if a 
respective signal is received from approaching vehicle. 
According to this project when a vehicle wants to 
communicate with the nearby vehicle, it is done by using the 
RF wireless communication technology. 


## Introduction

Our roads are jammed. As a result, practically all automakers must consider adding additional safety features and technological controls. Modern automobiles have variable illumination. The low and high beams 
alternate. At night, low lights illuminate the road ahead. When no other vehicles are present, bright lights are used to guide the car. They're also gaining ground. High lights illuminate silent roadways. 
So the driver can see obstacles. High beams are also utilized on unlit routes. An automatic high beam sensor. As a result of another high beam, our high beams automatically descend. Nowadays, light beams 
create numerous mishaps. On the basis of night vision, our study presents an efficient automated vehicle illumination adjustment. Control of high/low beams by robot Save time and energy with this project. 
This project allows cars to interact through RF without affecting the beam's manual capabilities. CMVR 105 (2) (ii), DMVR 112 (G) and 177 of MVA prohibit the use of headlights, taillights, and high 
beams (Motor Vehicle Act, 1988). High beams are illegal in certain city limits. On narrow roadways or approaching a car, use low beam. Drivers are required to use sealed beam high and low beam headlights. 
Quad headlamps with a “Autronic Eye” on each fender were standard on the 1955 Cadillac ELDORADO BROUGHAM. Free highway usage inner lighting AHBCS is already available, but only on highend cars. Most low-cost
automobiles' 60Ah batteries discharge in 10-12 starts. Ape (3W) and Porter (4W). Leaving the headlight on throughout the day causes frequent battery drain. Improper beam management also raises the danger of a 
The aim is to provide reliable solutions at low cost.

## EXISTING SYSTEM 
The existing system switches between high beam and low beam automatically whenever a vehicle is encountered in opposite direction. But this automatic switching might turn out as an issue for the driver itself. 
This system will react to non-moving vehicle or other light sources from road that hit the sensor installed on the car. This sensor has possibilities to get dirt and fails to work (to function). As a result, the 
light toggles between high and low beam in undesired conditions. driver may get confused and causes accident. This is a major drawback of the current system. Another system uses IOT to communicate with the other 
vehicle, but it is not possible to have internet connection at all places. 

##  PROPOSED SYSTEM

The number of vehicles on our roads is burgeoning day by day. This is turn forced almost all this vehicle manufacturer  to think about the extra safety instruments and electronic controls to attach with these products for 
giving the users a safety derived in all road conditionsthrough a mass flow traffic. If asked, one should always mention that the right driving is very cumbersome due to the dazzling light problems and the frequent dipping
of headlights by manual means that often causes fatigue to the driver particularly at the time of peak traffic. So naturally to get rid of this perennial problem, an automatic mechanism has to come up  to dip the headlamp 
automatically whenever required. For keeping a motor vehicle under perfect control and reins of the driver, different types of controls and accessories are provided in an automobile around the driver's seat, on the dashboard and at the footboard. 
Simply, an automatic high beam controller is a unit, which can automatically judge when the headlight beam needs to be lowered, and which dip the headlamp from which beam to a dipped beam. Our work proposes an 
effective automatic control of the vehicle headlamps based on the detection of head lights and tail lights under night time road conditions. This project is about to control high beam or low beam automatically. 
In this project we use two unit one is vehicle1 unit and another one is vehicle 2 unit. Both the units are placed with keypad, RF-HC12, lamp and controller to make the vehicle to vehicle communication 
much smarter. Keypad is used to send the data if any information’s wants to share with the nearby vehicle. Each buttons in the keypad has the unique information which was programmed in the Arduino controller. 
If any of the switches is pressed then that unique information’s like overtake request, emergency intimation, hill station heavy load and low beam high beam request. This data will be received in the vehicle 2 unit
and displayed in the LCD module. LDR sensor in the vehicle2 unit  is used to measure the light intensity of the opposite vehicle’s head lamp.
