# Auto_headlight_control
During night driving the headlight of vehicles 
must be switched properly. Mostly while driving vehicle 
drivers use high beam lights instead of low beam in all 
situations. The high beam should be used only when there’s 
low visibility or in highways and you should consider the 
other drivers in mind. While travelling in a dak road if you 
notice an oncoming vehicle or traffic, it’s advisable to switch 
the headlight to low beam. It can dazzle the driver ahead by 
reflecting in the rearview mirror and cause lose in visibility 
and result in accident. In this proposed idea the headlight 
can be controlled manually as well as automatically if a 
respective signal is received from approaching vehicle. 
According to this project when a vehicle wants to 
communicate with the nearby vehicle, it is done by using the 
RF wireless communication technology.
